# 🚀 AiAdminDashboard

**AiAdminDashboard** is a modern, AI-powered Admin Dashboard designed to manage users, metrics, reports, and notifications efficiently. It is built using **Angular** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** with **MongoDB** for the backend. The dashboard provides real-time notifications, AI-driven analytics insights, and robust role-based access control.

## 🌟 Features

- **User Management**: Add, delete, and view users with role-based permissions (`admin`, `manager`, `viewer`).
- **Metrics Dashboard**: View metrics in bar, line, and pie charts. Add new metrics dynamically.
- **Reports**: Export analytics reports in PDF and CSV formats.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications using Socket.IO.
- **Role-Based Access**: Secure routes and actions based on user roles.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive, glassmorphism-inspired UI with gradient buttons, badges, and smooth transitions.
- **AI Integration**: Ask AI for metric explanations and predictions.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 15+, HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap 5 (optional)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access
- **Styling**: SCSS, modern gradients, glass effects, card-style dashboards
